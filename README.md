USES GOOGLE GEMINI AND AMADEUS

As this was the first application i have ever made i ran into alot of obstacles such as getting my APIs to work, especially with the google AI which was really hard to setup for some reason so at one point i restarted a file and followed a guide online and it just kind of worked almost instantly which was pretty awesome.

Finding a package to use to make an actual visual app was pretty hard but once i found customttk it was perfect as it wasnt too hard to use and it made an alright looking ui.

The app uses amadeus API to find flights and create a table, and uses google clouds "Gemini Pro" Generative AI to create a list of things to do in the destination location as well as sort the relevant information from amadeus into a table.
